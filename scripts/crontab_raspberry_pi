# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
# 
# OpenWrt
# -------
# OpenWrt does not support @reboot directive. As a work around
#
#    1. In the crontab comment out the reboot directive with a single "#" and no spaces
#    2. Add startup script to /etc/init.d to process the commented out "#@reboot" directive
#
#         cp sys/open-wrt/scripts/cronatreboot to /etc/init.d/
#         /etc/init.d/crontatreboot enable
# 
# This needs to be do only once (part of the installation procedure).
#
# On the next boot the "#@reboot" line will be processed right after starting cron. 
# To test it, enter in the terminal "/etc/init.d/cronatreboot start". To undo this
# edit the crontab and insert an extra "#" like this "##@reboot ..".
#
# Raspberry Pi
# ------------
# On Raspberry Pi add $HOME/bin to the path (crontab does not support environment var)
PATH=/home/pi/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
#
# Scheduled tasks
# ---------------
# Ubx data is archived (and optionally pushed to the remote server) every hour at 7 minutes 
#    past the hour.
# Every hour, at xx:56, we check if the receivers are still logging and if necessary
#    try to restart logging.
# Every day, at 17 minutes past midnights UTC, daily RINEX files are created and send to
#    the remote server.
# Every Sunday and Wednesday, at 37 minutes past midnight, data is purged in case 
#    the disk is almost full 
#
